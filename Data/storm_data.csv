One brief tornado was documented, and there were numerous reports of large hail and damaging, straight-line, downburst, thunderstorm winds.  Most of the larger hailstones consisted of clumps of soft hail of various sizes.  The responsible surface low-pressure system developed in the Plains during the morning hours, and moved to northwest Wisconsin by the late evening hours.  Meanwhile, an associated surface warm front surged north into central Wisconsin during the morning hours, bringing unseasonably warm air into the area.  Maximum afternoon temperatures ranged from the upper 60s to mid 70s inland from Lake Michigan, with the highest reading of 77 in Janesville and 9NW Beloit.

As instability increased during the morning, isolated thunderstorms developed across eastern part of the state of Iowa.  These storms grew more intense and moved into south-central and southwest Wisconsin.  The first round of severe thunderstorms occurred as an elongated supercell crossed the Illinois/Wisconsin border and into Lafayette and Iowa counties between 1130 and 1220CST.  This storm produced .75 to 1.50 inch diameter hail before moving into Dane county where it split into two supercells.  The northern most supercell briefly produced an F0 tornado just east of Waunakee.  Both of these storms continued through Columbia, Dodge, and Fond du Lac counties where they produced funnel clouds, wind gusts to 56 knots (65 mph), and .75 to 1.25 inch diameter hail.  

As clouds began to decrease in the wake of these supercells, instability increased and scattered thunderstorms re-developed across south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the afternoon.  These storms quickly pulsed to severe limits, producing wind gusts generally between 52 and 60 knots (60 to 70 mph) and 3/4 to 1 inch diameter hail.  One thunderstorm's gust front produced a gustnado just northwest of St. Lawrence (Washington Co.) with estimated wind gusts to 65 knots (75 mph).

It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the "direct" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.

Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: "The Sky Just Exploded,"  "Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths," "New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,"  "Counting Losses, Blessings," "It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year," "It's a Mess Out Here," and "I've Never Experienced Anything Like This."  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.","The largest single-day tornado outbreak in Wisconsin recorded history for south-central and southeast Wisconsin occurred on August 18, 2005.

This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.  No crop losses were reported, given that the growing season had not started as of April 13th.

Based on partial insurance company information and some estimation, the April 13th hailstorms resulted in total damage amounts of about $158.55 million.  This makes the April 13th episode the most costly hailstorm to affect Wisconsin.  Collectively in 9 counties, at least 23,500 vehicle claims, at least 18,650 residential claims, and at least 2,515 business/farm claims were filed with various insurance companies through June 30, 2006.  These claims translated to at least $49.8 million in vehicle damage, at least $96.8 million in residential home damage, and at least $11.95 million in business/farm damage (new claims were still being filed as of June 28, 2006, therefore, these numbers may ultimately increase by 5 to 10%).   Insurance company numbers, as provided to the Milwaukee/Sullivan WFO (monetary value of claims and number of claims), were not broken down by county.  Therefore, estimated county-by-county breakdowns were derived - based on area affected in each county by hailstones 1.0 inches or larger, county population density, and relative sizes of the 20 largest insurance companies in Wisconsin. The estimated county monetary losses are: $66.59 million in Dane County, $22.2 million in both Iowa and Waukesha County, $17.44 million in Jefferson County, $7.93 million in both Milwaukee and Washington County, $6.34 million in Ozaukee County, $4.73 million in Lafayette County, and $3.17 million in Dodge County.  These county numbers were then broken down and appropriated to the largest of the individual hail reports within each county (see header strips above).

Last, but not least, a line of thunderstorms then pushed southeast out of Calumet and Manitowoc Counties through northeast Fond du Lac County and northern and eastern Sheboygan County between 2312CST and 2342CST. This line produced straight-line wind gusts up to an estimated 78 knots (90 mph) which caused extensive damage.  Northeast Fond du Lac County was affected at 2315-2320CST, extending from 1.0 mile northwest of Marytown to 1.9 miles east southeast of Marytown.  A dozen homes to sustain roof or siding damage, and on one farm a barn and a pole-shed were destroyed.  Another farm had a barn and a garage destroyed and the nearby home was moved.  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $500,000 in Fond du Lac County.  Sheboygan County was affected at 2325-2345CST, extending from Elkart Lake to 5 miles south of Sheboygan.  In this area, 2 barns and 5 pole sheds were destroyed, trees and powerlines were pushed onto several cars, a roof was torn off of a home in the city of Plymouth, and a roof was torn off a garage in the Town of Plymouth.  In addition, a cargo trailer in the city of Sheboygan was blown 60 to 70 feet and smashed into a building that housed several businesses.  About 300 customers in the city of Plymouth were without power.  The Sheboygan ASOS equipment at the Sheboygan airport northwest of the city of Sheboygan recorded a gust of 58 knots (67 mph).  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $400,000 in Sheboygan County.

Northeast Fond du Lac County was affected at 2315-2320CST, extending from 1.0 mile northwest of Marytown to 1.9 miles east southeast of Marytown.  A dozen homes to sustain roof or siding damage, and on one farm a barn and a pole-shed were destroyed.  Another farm had a barn and a garage destroyed and the nearby home was moved.

Here's what happened: scattered supercells developed in eastern Iowa during the late afternoon hours of April 13th and pushed east-northeastward through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois during the evening.  Three main hailstorms affected southern Wisconsin.  The first hailstorm left a swath of hail and hail damage from southern Iowa County (around 1945CST), through central Dane County, through northern Jefferson County, through northern Waukesha County, to northern Milwaukee County by 2151CST.  This storm produced mainly 1 to 4 inch diameter hail, with a 4.25 inch hailstone reported by a State Trooper about 3 miles northwest of Lake Mills at 2055CST (larger hailstones of 4.5 to 5.7 inches in diameter have been reported in Wisconsin in previous years).

The third hailstorm developed in southern Dodge County around 2056CST, and pushed through southern Washington County into central Ozaukee County by 2139CST.  This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.

Wisconsin's most-costly hailstorm pummeled a large swath from around Mineral Point (Iowa Co.) to north of Milwaukee (Milwaukee Co.), while hurricane-force thunderstorm winds raked parts of Fond du Lac and Sheboygan Counties.  Here's what happened: scattered supercells developed in eastern Iowa during the late afternoon hours of April 13th and pushed east-northeastward through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois during the evening.  Three main hailstorms affected southern Wisconsin.  The first hailstorm left a swath of hail and hail damage from southern Iowa County (around 1945CST), through central Dane County, through northern Jefferson County, through northern Waukesha County, to northern Milwaukee County by 2151CST.  This storm produced mainly 1 to 4 inch diameter hail, with a 4.25 inch hailstone reported by a State Trooper about 3 miles northwest of Lake Mills at 2055CST (larger hailstones of 4.5 to 5.7 inches in diameter have been reported in Wisconsin in previous years).  A second hailstorm developed just south of the first storm and left a swath of hail and hail damage from northern Lafayette County (around 1956CST through northern Green County, through southeast Dane County., through central and southern Jefferson County, through central Waukesha County, to central Milwaukee County by 2210CST.  This storm produced hailstones up to 1.5 inch in diameter.  The third hailstorm developed in southern Dodge County around 2056CST, and pushed through southern Washington County into central Ozaukee County by 2139CST.  This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.  No crop losses were reported, given that the growing season had not started as of April 13th.

Based on partial insurance company information and some estimation, the April 13th hailstorms resulted in total damage amounts of about $158.55 million.

Collectively in 9 counties, at least 23,500 vehicle claims, at least 18,650 residential claims, and at least 2,515 business/farm claims were filed with various insurance companies through June 30, 2006.  These claims translated to at least $49.8 million in vehicle damage, at least $96.8 million in residential home damage, and at least $11.95 million in business/farm damage (new claims were still being filed as of June 28, 2006, therefore, these numbers may ultimately increase by 5 to 10%).   Insurance company numbers, as provided to the Milwaukee/Sullivan WFO (monetary value of claims and number of claims), were not broken down by county.  Therefore, estimated county-by-county breakdowns were derived - based on area affected in each county by hailstones 1.0 inches or larger, county population density, and relative sizes of the 20 largest insurance companies in Wisconsin. The estimated county monetary losses are: $66.59 million in Dane County, $22.2 million in both Iowa and Waukesha County, $17.44 million in Jefferson County, $7.93 million in both Milwaukee and Washington County, $6.34 million in Ozaukee County, $4.73 million in Lafayette County, and $3.17 million in Dodge County.

Here's what happened: scattered supercells developed in eastern Iowa during the late afternoon hours of April 13th and pushed east-northeastward through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois during the evening.  Three main hailstorms affected southern Wisconsin.  The first hailstorm left a swath of hail and hail damage from southern Iowa County (around 1945CST), through central Dane County, through northern Jefferson County, through northern Waukesha County, to northern Milwaukee County by 2151CST.  This storm produced mainly 1 to 4 inch diameter hail, with a 4.25 inch hailstone reported by a State Trooper about 3 miles northwest of Lake Mills at 2055CST (larger hailstones of 4.5 to 5.7 inches in diameter have been reported in Wisconsin in previous years).  A second hailstorm developed just south of the first storm and left a swath of hail and hail damage from northern Lafayette County (around 1956CST through northern Green County, through southeast Dane County., through central and southern Jefferson County, through central Waukesha County, to central Milwaukee County by 2210CST.  This storm produced hailstones up to 1.5 inch in diameter.  The third hailstorm developed in southern Dodge County around 2056CST, and pushed through southern Washington County into central Ozaukee County by 2139CST.  This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.  No crop losses were reported, given that the growing season had not started as of April 13th.

Based on partial insurance company information and some estimation, the April 13th hailstorms resulted in total damage amounts of about $158.55 million.  This makes the April 13th episode the most costly hailstorm to affect Wisconsin.  Collectively in 9 counties, at least 23,500 vehicle claims, at least 18,650 residential claims, and at least 2,515 business/farm claims were filed with various insurance companies through June 30, 2006.  These claims translated to at least $49.8 million in vehicle damage, at least $96.8 million in residential home damage, and at least $11.95 million in business/farm damage (new claims were still being filed as of June 28, 2006, therefore, these numbers may ultimately increase by 5 to 10%).   Insurance company numbers, as provided to the Milwaukee/Sullivan WFO (monetary value of claims and number of claims), were not broken down by county.  Therefore, estimated county-by-county breakdowns were derived - based on area affected in each county by hailstones 1.0 inches or larger, county population density, and relative sizes of the 20 largest insurance companies in Wisconsin. The estimated county monetary losses are: $66.59 million in Dane County, $22.2 million in both Iowa and Waukesha County, $17.44 million in Jefferson County, $7.93 million in both Milwaukee and Washington County, $6.34 million in Ozaukee County, $4.73 million in Lafayette County, and $3.17 million in Dodge County.

Northeast Fond du Lac County was affected at 2315-2320CST, extending from 1.0 mile northwest of Marytown to 1.9 miles east southeast of Marytown.  A dozen homes to sustain roof or siding damage, and on one farm a barn and a pole-shed were destroyed.  Another farm had a barn and a garage destroyed and the nearby home was moved.  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $500,000 in Fond du Lac County.  Sheboygan County was affected at 2325-2345CST, extending from Elkart Lake to 5 miles south of Sheboygan.  In this area, 2 barns and 5 pole sheds were destroyed, trees and powerlines were pushed onto several cars, a roof was torn off of a home in the city of Plymouth, and a roof was torn off a garage in the Town of Plymouth.

A second hailstorm developed just south of the first storm and left a swath of hail and hail damage from northern Lafayette County (around 1956CST through northern Green County, through southeast Dane County., through central and southern Jefferson County, through central Waukesha County, to central Milwaukee County by 2210CST.  This storm produced hailstones up to 1.5 inch in diameter.  The third hailstorm developed in southern Dodge County around 2056CST, and pushed through southern Washington County into central Ozaukee County by 2139CST.  This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.  No crop losses were reported, given that the growing season had not started as of April 13th.

Based on partial insurance company information and some estimation, the April 13th hailstorms resulted in total damage amounts of about $158.55 million.  This makes the April 13th episode the most costly hailstorm to affect Wisconsin.  Collectively in 9 counties, at least 23,500 vehicle claims, at least 18,650 residential claims, and at least 2,515 business/farm claims were filed with various insurance companies through June 30, 2006.  These claims translated to at least $49.8 million in vehicle damage, at least $96.8 million in residential home damage, and at least $11.95 million in business/farm damage (new claims were still being filed as of June 28, 2006, therefore, these numbers may ultimately increase by 5 to 10%).   Insurance company numbers, as provided to the Milwaukee/Sullivan WFO (monetary value of claims and number of claims), were not broken down by county.  Therefore, estimated county-by-county breakdowns were derived - based on area affected in each county by hailstones 1.0 inches or larger, county population density, and relative sizes of the 20 largest insurance companies in Wisconsin. The estimated county monetary losses are: $66.59 million in Dane County, $22.2 million in both Iowa and Waukesha County, $17.44 million in Jefferson County, $7.93 million in both Milwaukee and Washington County, $6.34 million in Ozaukee County, $4.73 million in Lafayette County, and $3.17 million in Dodge County.  These county numbers were then broken down and appropriated to the largest of the individual hail reports within each county (see header strips above).

Last, but not least, a line of thunderstorms then pushed southeast out of Calumet and Manitowoc Counties through northeast Fond du Lac County and northern and eastern Sheboygan County between 2312CST and 2342CST. This line produced straight-line wind gusts up to an estimated 78 knots (90 mph) which caused extensive damage.  Northeast Fond du Lac County was affected at 2315-2320CST, extending from 1.0 mile northwest of Marytown to 1.9 miles east southeast of Marytown.  A dozen homes to sustain roof or siding damage, and on one farm a barn and a pole-shed were destroyed.  Another farm had a barn and a garage destroyed and the nearby home was moved.  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $500,000 in Fond du Lac County.  Sheboygan County was affected at 2325-2345CST, extending from Elkart Lake to 5 miles south of Sheboygan.  In this area, 2 barns and 5 pole sheds were destroyed, trees and powerlines were pushed onto several cars, a roof was torn off of a home in the city of Plymouth, and a roof was torn off a garage in the Town of Plymouth.  In addition, a cargo trailer in the city of Sheboygan was blown 60 to 70 feet and smashed into a building that housed several businesses.  About 300 customers in the city of Plymouth were without power.  The Sheboygan ASOS equipment at the Sheboygan airport northwest of the city of Sheboygan recorded a gust of 58 knots (67 mph).  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $400,000 in Sheboygan County.  Synopically, a stationary front draped itself over southern Wisconsin during the afternoon and evening of April 13th.  Temperatures climbed into the mid 70s across south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the afternoon.  Moderate low-level instability, cold air aloft, and strong vertical wind-shear profiles with very steep lapse-rates caused storms to fire and produce giant hail.",87

There were no reports of injuries or deaths.  The heavy rain resulted from slow-moving and back-building thunderstorms that essentially remained nearly stationary over the city of Madison.  The hilly terrain and a typical urban setting of a lot of concrete and asphalt enable the runoff water to quickly overwhelm the storm sewers and concentrate water in low-lying areas of the city.  Water depths reach to the top of small vehicles - 4 to 5 feet deep in spots.  Many roads became impassable due to the flood waters, and many residential homes and businesses on or near the UW-Madison campus had flooded basement and first-floor flooding.  Some  basement apartment units had water depths of 6 to 8 feet.   Nearly all campus buildings had flooding of varying degrees of intensity, and the Camp Randall football field sustained damage.  Some campus buildings had flat roofs that quickly flooded as storm drains became plugged - which allowed water to run thru the walls and ceilings of buildings.  The buildings that sustained the most damage were the Memorial Union, Computer Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine.  Numerous vehicles on or near the campus were damaged or totaled by the flood waters, and some were reported to be floating away.  Unofficial rain gages measured 4.5 to 5 inches from just west of West High School up to the Capitol Square.  WSR-88D Doppler rainfall estimates were in the 3 to 5 inch rain, therefore it appears the unofficial rain gages were very accurate.  Rainfall amounts quickly fell off to 1 to 1.5 inches near the south Beltline (STH14/18/151).

The lowest pressure in Wisconsin occurred at Superior, in far northwest Wisconsin, measuring 961.3 millibars (28.39) at 11:15 AM CDT on the 26th. The previous lowest sea level pressure recorded in Wisconsin was 963.4 millibars (28.45) at Green Bay on April 3 of 1982. |Madison had the second lowest sea level pressure reading on record at 975.3 millibars (28.80 inches of mercury), and Milwaukee had the seventh lowest reading on record at 978.7 millibars (28.90 inches of mercury).  ||Severe thunderstorms formed along and ahead of a cold front surging eastward ahead of the low. An EF1 tornado formed in northern Kenosha County and tracked northeast across portions of central and eastern Racine County. There were also numerous reports of wind damage from severe thunderstorm winds.  All of this severe weather activity is documented in tornado and thunderstorm wind events for October 26th.  After the cold front passage, strong subsidence in the dry slot of the system produced gradient winds of 22 to 38 knots (25 to 45 mph), with measured gusts to 55 knots (63 mph).  Based on severity of resultant damage, isolated maximum wind gusts may have been as high as 61-64 knots (70-75 mph), especially on ridge tops.||The slow-moving low kept the tight pressure gradient draped across south-central and southeast Wisconsin Wednesday, October 27th. Wind speeds slowed for a time Tuesday night as nocturnal cooling prevented mixing up to the strong winds within 3,000 feet of the ground. However, mixing after sunrise on the 27th tapped these stronger winds, with average mixed-layer winds around 50 knots. Winds at many locations were stronger on Wednesday than Tuesday; with sustained speeds of 26 to 39 knots (30 to 45 mph), and estimated gusts to 56 knots (65 mph).

Very strong winds were associated with this storm for an extended period of time. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph were common through the event, with peak wind gusts between 45 and 50 mph. The combination of high winds and heavy snow created widespread sustained visibilities of less than 1/4 mile, with frequent whiteout conditions and near zero visibilities. Twenty-four hour snowfall totals were between 12 and 14 inches, with 14.5 inches of snow measured in Middleton, 12.7 inches recorded at Dane County Regional Airport, 12.2 inches in Portage and 12 inches in Mineral Point. In addition to the snow that fell during the blizzard, several inches of snow fell on Jan 31. It's possible that some locations did not see a break in snowfall between the evening of January 31st and the morning of February 2nd. Many cooperative observer stations set records for multi-day snowfall totals. Stoughton tied a record with a one-day (2/1) snowfall of 14 inches, and set new two-day (1/31-2/1) and three-day (1/31-2/2) record snowfalls with 19.1 inches for each period. Snow drifts of 3 to 6 feet were common, with reports of some drifts reaching 12 to 15 feet in open rural areas. Drifting snow closed county roads, with many stranded motorists having to be rescued from vehicles buried in the drifting snow. About 100 National Guardsman were mobilized statewide in response to Gov. Scott Walker's emergency declaration for 29 counties to help rescue motorists and run emergency shelters at armories. The blizzard led to early dismissals on February 1st at many area schools, and kept them closed through February 3rd. Snow drifted up to the roof of the Yahara Elementary School in De Forest (Dane County). The strong, gusty winds sheared off the sign at a Super 8 motel in Columbus in Columbia County.",372

Visibilities were reduced to around 1/2 mile.  Only those counties bordering Illinois escaped the storm.  The counties of Iowa, Dane, Jefferson, Waukesha, and Milwaukee picked up about 1/4 inch of ice due to freezing rain, and followed this with 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet and then light snow of 1/2 to 1.5 inches.

Overall forcing for ascent over the region was provided by  differential vorticity advection ahead of a progressive 500 mb negatively-tilted trough, with the storms developing on the nose of a moderate to strong low-level jet ahead of the wave. Moderate instability, reflected in mixed-layer CAPE values of 1000 to 1200 J/kg, and favorable wind shear contributed to conditions that produced broken bands of thunderstorms with damaging wind gusts and downbursts.",500
